# Wireless-Blood-Pressure-Monitor
A wireless blood pressure monitor with completed hardware design. Software development is still in progress for the bluetooth enabled microcontroller. A PCB design software(KiCad, Eagle, Etc.) is required to open the files. For accessibility, I have stored images of the schematic and PCB layout in a seperate images folder.
